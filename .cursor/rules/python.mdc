# Python Development Standards

Python version: [3.14](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html)

**Note**: When uncertain about Python 3.14 features or syntax, navigate to the official documentation to verify current capabilities.

## Python 3.14 Key Features

Python 3.14 (released October 7, 2025) includes these notable features:

- **Deferred evaluation of annotations (PEP 649)** - Type annotations are evaluated lazily, improving startup time and enabling forward references
- **Template string literals (PEP 750)** - New syntax for creating template strings with embedded expressions
- **Simplified except* syntax (PEP 758)** - `except*` expressions can now be used without brackets
- **Control flow in finally blocks (PEP 765)** - `return`, `break`, and `continue` statements are now allowed in `finally` blocks
- **Subinterpreters (PEP 734)** - Multiple interpreters in the standard library for better concurrency
- **compression.zstd module** - Native Zstandard compression support
- **Improved async introspection** - Better tools for inspecting async code
- **Free-threaded mode improvements** - Enhanced GIL-free execution capabilities


## General principles

Follow these principles when writing Python code:

### Code Style

- **Write simple, clean, and concise pythonic code**
- **Always add type hints** - Use type annotations for all function parameters and return types
- **Use absolute imports** - Never use relative imports
- **Prefer functional style where possible** - Functions over classes when appropriate
- **Apply the Zen of Python** - Beautiful is better than ugly, Simple is better than complex, etc.

### Naming conventions

- **Functions/methods**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Variables**: `snake_case`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Fields**: `snake_case`
- **Private Methods**: `_leading_underscore`

### Documentation

- **Don't generate docstrings** unless it's a public API or explicitly requested
- **Don't write comments** - Good code documents itself through clear naming and structure
- If documentation is needed, prefer self-documenting code over comments

### Design Patterns

- **RERO (Receive an Object, Return an Object)** - Functions should receive objects and return objects, not primitives when dealing with domain concepts
- **SLAP (Single Level of Abstraction Principle)** - Each function should operate at a single level of abstraction
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** - Favor simplicity over complexity; write straightforward solutions
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Don't add functionality until it's actually needed
- **Use dataclasses for models** - Prefer `@dataclass` over regular classes for data models

### Type Hints

Always include type hints:

```python
from typing import Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int

def process_user(user: User) -> Optional[User]:
    # Implementation
    return user
```

### Imports

Use absolute imports:

```python
# Good
from src.your_package.models import User
from src.your_package.services import UserService

# Bad
from .models import User
from ..services import UserService
```

## Functional Style

Prefer functional patterns:

```python
# Good - functional style
def filter_active_users(users: list[User]) -> list[User]:
    return [user for user in users if user.is_active]

# Prefer over imperative style when possible
```

### Data Models

Use dataclasses for models:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

@dataclass
class Product:
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float
    description: Optional[str] = None
```

## General Best Practices

- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid premature optimization
- Write code that is easy to read and understand
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Handle errors explicitly with proper exception types
